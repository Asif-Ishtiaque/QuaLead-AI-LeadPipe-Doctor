"""The self-healing half of the agent loop: given a traceback raised by the
cleaning engine, ask the local LLM to rewrite app/cleaning/transforms.py so
the failure stops happening, then write the patch to disk (with a backup)
so the next pipeline retry picks it up.

This can only work while Ollama is reachable -- rewriting code isn't
something the heuristic fallback used elsewhere in this project can do, so
if the LLM is unavailable we surface that clearly and let the caller route
straight to human review instead of retrying blind.
