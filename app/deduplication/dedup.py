"""Fuzzy deduplication across name, phone, and email.

Two leads are considered the same person if they share an exact non-null
email, share an exact non-null phone (already E.164-normalized), or have a
close fuzzy name match. Within each duplicate cluster we keep the "best"
record -- the one with the fewest missing fields, breaking ties by most
recent created_at.

A naive all-pairs comparison is O(n^2), which doesn't hold up at the
100k+ lead volumes this pipeline is meant to run at. Instead we use a
union-find over exact keys (email, phone) plus a last-name-prefix bucket for
the fuzzy name pass, so fuzzy comparison only ever happens within small
same-prefix groups instead of across the whole dataset.
