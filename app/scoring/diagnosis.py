"""Human-readable lead diagnosis and a suggested next action.

Both are derived deterministically from the same feature vector the scorer
already computes (app/scoring/features.py) plus the lead's status and
quality_score -- no separate LLM call. That's deliberate: a sales manager
needs the "why" behind a score to be specific, consistent run-to-run, and
instant, none of which a generative model guarantees. Every phrase below
maps to a concrete, inspectable signal, so the explanation can never drift
from the number it's explaining.

diagnose(lead) -> "why this score", e.g.
  "Medium-quality lead (score 55). Strengths: non-personal email domain,
   both email and phone captured. Concerns: no marketing consent
   captured."

suggest_action(lead) -> what a rep should do next, e.g.
  "Add to an email nurture sequence; escalate to a rep if they engage.
   No consent on file: do not cold-call (TCPA), email only with a lawful
   basis."
