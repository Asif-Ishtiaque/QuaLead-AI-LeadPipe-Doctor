"""Runs mapped-but-still-messy records through the field transforms in
transforms.py, producing records shaped like the canonical Lead schema
(still pre-validation).

`transforms` is imported lazily through `_load_transforms()` rather than
once at module scope, so that after the self-healing agent rewrites
app/cleaning/transforms.py on disk, a fresh `importlib.reload` picks up the
patched code on the very next retry without restarting the process.
