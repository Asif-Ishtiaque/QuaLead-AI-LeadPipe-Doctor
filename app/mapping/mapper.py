"""Maps arbitrary source field names onto the canonical schema.

Resolution order per field:
  1. Exact-match memory in ChromaDB -- have we mapped this (source, field
     name) pair before? If so, reuse it for free.
  2. Ask the local LLM, grounded with the nearest canonical field
     descriptions retrieved from ChromaDB (RAG).
  3. If Ollama is unreachable, fall back to a synonym/fuzzy-match heuristic
     so the pipeline still runs without any LLM available.

Every fresh resolution (LLM or heuristic) is written back to ChromaDB, which
is what makes mapping "improve over time": the second time a source sends
the same field name, step 1 answers instantly.

- "Which campaign brought you here?" -> campaign_id
- "May we contact you about updates?" -> consent
Only answer "unknown" if the field genuinely doesn't correspond to any
canonical field below, not just because the wording is indirect.
